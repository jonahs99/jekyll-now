title: Contours- A generative art idea
---

I have made some progress testing the original concept this past week.

Today my goal is to try a continous winding instead of individual contours, because I the contours don't like to line up.

Also, I want to make sure that movement in the parallel direction is maintain so I don't turn around backwards.

Lastly, I am not happy with the graphics quality of drawing rasterized lines directly, so I will try outputting SVG that I can render nicely later.
